= Flask/Svelte Simple Demo
:date: 20 July 2019

== Introduction
This is a simple demo of using http://flask.pocoo.org/[Flask] with https://svelte.dev/[Svelte]. This demo provides a page with a button that will call to an endpoint for a random number.

== Requirements
This demo was written with the Windows OS in mind although it should be easy enough to run on other operating systems. All dependencies should be listed in the main `_Check_Dependencies.bat` which is generated from `install\dependencies.popyaml` using https://github.com/jeffrimko/PopPage[PopPage]. Additionally, a Python requirements file is available at `install\requirements.txt`. Local Node modules will be installed when the app is started the first time.

== Usage
A https://pypi.org/project/ubuild/[Ubuild] script is provided at `_Run.py` which should handle the basics like starting/stopping the server and viewing the app.
